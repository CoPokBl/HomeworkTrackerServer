# HomeworkTrackerServer

## Why don't you use ASP.NET
Yeah, I know that I could use ASP.NET. But I prefer making the whole API by myself so I did, I don't want the help of ASP.NETs builtin features.

## So what is this?
This is an API for tracking homework, I will be making clients that support this server so that you can save your homework and access it on multiple devices. 

## Contact me
I prefer to use discord for communication, you can DM me at CoPokBl#9451

## Clients
Here is the current list of clients:
### Console Clients (These are just for testing):
- https://github.com/Calcilore/HomeworkTrackerConsoleClient (All platforms that support dotnet. If you'd like an example of how to make a client I recommend using this)

### Desktop Clients
- https://github.com/CoPokBl/HomeworkTrackerUnityClient (Linux, Windows and Mac OS. Coming soon to mobile as well)

### Mobile Clients
None yet

If you'd like to have a client you made added to this repo DM me on discord (CoPokBl#9451)
