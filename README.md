# HomeworkTrackerServer

## Now using ASP.NET
I have remade this project in ASP.NET because it's a lot more clean, in C# ASP.NET is actually designed for APIs and handles a lot of the lower level code for you leading to A LOT less bugs. In this remake I have also made the API work the intended way when it comes to API and it now uses a structure like /api/tasks/GUID and uses the different request types (POST, PUT, GET...). **TLDR: I made it better**

## So what is this?
This is an API for keeping track of your homework, I will be making clients that support this server so that you can save your homework and access it on multiple devices. 

## Background
Yeah there are probably alternatives but I am making this to learn more about APIs and how they work, this is NOT a commercial project. I may stop working on this at any time if I get bored and I don't have any goals beyond making it fully functional. I will add features as a see fit or as I want them, you can suggest features but I won't necessarily add them.
